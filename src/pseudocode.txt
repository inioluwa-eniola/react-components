Refactoring of the code to implement content taught in course and to be more scalable

    - Compound components 
    - Context
    - Composition
    - Render props 
    - Custom hooks 


Children:
    - 



Plan 
1. Having written the logic for conditional rendering, create the styles for the various designs
    - write the CSS, provide screenshots to chatGPT and let it critique whether your styling was effective 

2. Move to the tooltip design:
    - Components: 
        - Tooltip
        - TooltipImage - attach the close button to the image since displaying it does not require context
        - TooltipIcon 
        - TooltipText
    - Receive these props:
        - "color(ie black, blue, purple, green) shade(ie light or dark)"
    - Create a custom component eventually

3. Move on to the toast design:
    - Components: 
        - Toast 
        - Use a custom component from the beginning
